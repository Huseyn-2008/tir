## Overview

`tir` is a simple command-line project manager designed to assist in creating and managing projects. It provides basic commands for managing projects.

You can use it in any directory by adding the `tir` folder to your system variables.

## Attention, Please!

After installing TIR in 'C:\Program Files (x86)', if you encounter issues creating a project using the command 'tir new <project_name>' and it doesn't generate the project as expected, please ensure that you open your terminal with administrator permissions to resolve any potential permission-related issues.

## Create a Project

```bash
tir new <project_name> # Creates main.py inside the project
```

## Delete a Project

```bash
tir clear <project_name> # Clears the project
```

## Run a Project

```bash
tir run # Runs the project
```
